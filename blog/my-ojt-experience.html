<h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was adapting to the fast-paced environment of a professional law firm while learning new technologies. Initially, I struggled with understanding the legal terminology and requirements, but through persistence and guidance from my mentors, I learned to bridge the gap between technical implementation and legal needs.</p>

<p>I also learned the importance of documentation and clear communication. Working with AI systems required precise prompt engineering, and I discovered that small changes in wording could significantly impact the quality of AI responses. This taught me to be more methodical and detail-oriented in my work.</p>

Seeing the system work efficiently and receiving positive feedback from the legal team was incredibly rewarding. It was a moment that validated my choice to pursue a career in technology.</p>

<p>Another highlight was participating in team meetings where I could contribute ideas and see them being implemented. The collaborative environment taught me the value of diverse perspectives and how different viewpoints can lead to better solutions.</p>
